Road Traffic Flow Monitoring based on SafeUAV

This is a project of the Summer Campus in 2020.07, which is aimed to realize the function of the road traffic flow monitoring.

First of all, is necessary for every colleagues to learn about the *SafeUAV Algorithm*. Here is the [website](https://sites.google.com/site/aerialimageunderstanding/safeuav-learning-to-estimate-depth-and-safe-landing-areas-for-uavs) of the research team who proposed the SafeUAV Algorithm.
